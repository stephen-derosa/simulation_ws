# simulation_ws
Workspace for Gazebo/Ros simulations.

All Gazebo worlds generated before 03/21 are from the following site: 
http://data.nvision2.eecs.yorku.ca/3DGEMS/

To actually launch the worlds, you must download their "Downloads" and include
them inside your GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH (defaults to ~/.gazebo/models)
